You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Good luck!



Raw Data
  1. Data from the data source with no modifications
Tidy Data
  1. Each variable in one column
  2. Each observation in a row
  3. One table for each kind
  4. Id to link items in seperate variables
Code Book to describe how you go from one to the other
  1. Information about variables
  2. Information about summary choices
  3. Invormation about the experimental study design used
R code to do that transformation
  1. Ideally computer script
  2. The input script is the raw data
  3. The output is the processed, tidy data
  4. There are no parameters to script
